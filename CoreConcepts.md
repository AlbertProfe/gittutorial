## Definition



**Git** Git is a **version control system (also called a source control system)** that allows programmers and other people working with text files to coordinate changes while working independently.

Git also supports binary assets such as pictures, but those formats 
donâ€™t support the line-by-line version management that makes version 
control really powerful.
